# Link_Evaluator

A tool that somehow tries to evaluate links by atrributing them a seriousness value. Maybe another value which political direction it can be associated with (wether more progressive or more conservative). Maybe even some more values that then can be represented visually.

This tool might be very delicate and problematic but might become better and trusted by time.

What do you think aubot this?
